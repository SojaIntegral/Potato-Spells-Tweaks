# Bonus attributes system

## Rules:
### 1. All entities must be on `potato_whitelist.json` or it won't work
### 2. All entities must be in ONE rank (see rank folder)
### 3. All entities must be in ONE race (see race_system folder)
### 4. All entities must be in AT LEAST ONE element (see elemental_system folder)

You ***can*** apply attributes to players, but that doesn't mean that you should.

If you wish to apply attributes to players, use "minecraft:player".
Yes... This work like origins. Kinda.
