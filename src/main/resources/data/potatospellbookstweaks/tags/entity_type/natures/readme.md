# Natures System


### BE CAREFUL!!
1. Natures cannot be reversed without commands
2. Natures cannot be edited without commands
3. Natures add a 10% bonus to an attribute and a -10% to another (can be the same, making it 0%)
4. Removing natures with commands before removing the mob from the list and reloading the world will cause them to just get it back
