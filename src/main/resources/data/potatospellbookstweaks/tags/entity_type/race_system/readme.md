**Every mob must have only one race**

## Humans:
- Have average attributes 
- This race is used only for players

## Dragonborn:
- Have high resistances, just like dragons, but failed to succeed their immense magical talents
- Dragonborn are slightly above humans in overall strength

## Humanoids:
- Have some weaknesses and strengths, but are very balanced
- This is used for human-like mobs like mages, villagers, etc

## Undead:
- Well... They are not alive
- Less resistant than humans, but higher resistance to magic due to their innate magical nature

## Brute:
- Animals and animal-like creatures
- Have higher defense and attack, but aren't that great against magic

## Insect:
- Before anyone says, yes it also includes arachnids
- They aren't very resistant or strong, or good at magic... But they will always find a way to hurt you

## Flying:
- Flying creatures, like phantoms or other modded birbs
- They aren't as weak as insects, but they are way faster

## Fish:
- Water
- Squishy and not that hard to kill
- They somehow are decent at magic...? Kinda...

## Golem:
- Very tough
- Their magic qualities make them great at magic, but they are relatively slow

## Construct:
- They are more technological and advanced their golems
- Gained great speed and damage at the cost of magical abilities

## Spirit:
- The crystalised essence of magic
- Spirits are very frail, but their powers are the greatest out of all races

## Amorph:
- Things without proper form, mysterious natural (or unnatural) creatures
- Amorph creatures are slightly above average, with very defined weaknesses and strengths

## Dragon:
- The most powerful of all races
- Dragons have high resistances and armor, making them extremely tough enemies
- On top of that, dragons are also extremely proficient at magic
- WARNING: Do not make players dragons! It will feel like actual cheating! Use the dragon-born tag!
